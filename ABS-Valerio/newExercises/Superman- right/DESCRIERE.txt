1. Kneel on all fours with your knees under your hips and hip-distance apart and put your hands on the floor a shoulder-width apart under your shoulders. Put your spine into the neutral position. Activate your core by drawing your abdominal muscles back toward your spine.

2. Without any sideways movement and keeping your abdomen pulled in, exhale and slowly raise an opposite arm and leg until they are parallel to the floor. Be careful to follow the tempo you have set.

3. Inhale and slowly return your arm and leg to the starting position.

4. Repeat for the desired number of reps, then repeat the exercise using the other arm and leg.
