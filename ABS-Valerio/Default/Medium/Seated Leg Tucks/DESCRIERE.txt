Main Muscle: Abdominals
Other Muscle: None

1. This is a good overall exercise for the abs. Sit at the end of a bench or on the floor. Hold the bench with your hands right behind your butt. If you are on the floor keep your hands on the sides for stability. Keep your legs up and sightly bend and hold your abs contracted.

2. Slowly bring your legs to your torso/ribcage and return them to their original position.
