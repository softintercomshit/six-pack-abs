Main Muscle: Obliques
Other Muscle: Rectus Abdominis

1. Keep your legs straight and extend your right arm along the floor (for balance) while lying on your right side. Cup your left hand behind your head while holding your head a few inches above the floor with your elbow pointing toward the ceiling, as shown. Remember to keep your head still (do not bend it toward your feet) throughout the movement phase.

2. Contract the muscles of the left side of your torso while moving your upper torso toward your feet so that your upper body curls in a smooth arc. Simultaneously, lift your legs upward, while keeping your ankles locked together, to form a “V” Shape with your body. When your obliques are fully contracted, begin returning slowly to the starting position. Reverse your position afterward doing several repeats to work the right side of the body.
