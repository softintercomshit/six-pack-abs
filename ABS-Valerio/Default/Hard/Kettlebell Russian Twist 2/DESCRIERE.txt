1. Sit on a ball with a kettlebell or dumbbell at your side. Hold your legs firmly on the floor. Keep your chest lifted and back straight.

2. Pick up the dumbbell or kettlebell, holding it upside down by the handles for better control. It should be at chest height.

3. Lean back slightly, being careful not to round your back. 

4. Quickly twist from side to side, leading with the kettlebell. Your entire chest and head region should rotate while your legs stay stationary. Squeeze your abs throughout the exercise.
