1. Sit on the floor with a kettlebell or a medicine ball at your side. Put your legs together and bend your knees. Keep your chest lifted and back straight.

2. Pick up the medicine ball or kettlebell, holding it upside down by the handles for better control. It should be at chest height.

3. Lean back slightly, being careful not to round your back. Lift your feet off the floor but keep your knees together and legs bent.

4. Quickly twist from side to side, leading with the kettlebell. Your entire chess and head region should rotate while your legs stay stationary. Squeeze your abs throughout the exercise.
