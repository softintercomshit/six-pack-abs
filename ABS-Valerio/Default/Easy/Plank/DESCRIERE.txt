1. Begin by getting into pushup position, but bend your elbows and rest your weight on your forearms instead of using your hands as illustrated. Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders down to your ankles.

2. Brace your core by contracting your abdominal muscles in this position. Hold for roughly 30 seconds, then release.
