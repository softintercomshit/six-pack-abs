Main Muscle: Obliques
Other Muscle: Lower Back

1. Stand upright with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width and hold a barbell behind your neck. Place the barbell so that it rests on your shoulders and trapezius muscles, as illustrated.

2. While holding on, bend to one side while keeping your legs and hips motionless. You should feel your abdominal obliques and lower back doing the work.

3. Return to starting position and bend the other way, then return to upright stating position once more.
